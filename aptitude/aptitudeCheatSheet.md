## Percentages

- Percentage means per 100

### Formulas

## Increment/Decrement:

- A successive increase of a% and b% is equivalent to a net increase of a + b + ((a x b) / 100) %
- A successive decrease of a% and b% is equivalent to a net decrease of a + b – ((a x b) / 100) %
- A successive increase of a% and decrease of b% is equivalent to a net change of a – b + ((a x (-b) / 100) % = a – b – ((a x b) / 100) %
- A successive decrease of a% and increase of b% is equivalent to a net change of b – a + (((-a) x b) / 100) % = b – a – ((a x b) / 100) %
- An increase by n % and a successive decrease by n % is equal to an equivalent decrease of (n/10)2 %

## Population / Expenditure :

- If the population of a group/community/country/place(etc.) is currently P and if it increases by R % every year, then :
    - Population after ‘n’ years = P x [1 + (R / 100)]<sup>n</sup>
    - Population before ‘n’ years = P / [1 + (R / 100)]<sup>n</sup>

## Deprecation:

- Depreciation : If the price (or value) of an article is currently P and if it depreciates by R % every year, then:
    - Price (or value) after ‘n’ years = P x [1 – (R / 100)]<sup>n</sup>
    - Price (or value) before ‘n’ years = P / [1 – (R / 100)]<sup>n</sup>
